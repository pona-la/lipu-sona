Before we discover a whole new type of words and new grammar, let's fill in some
blanks.

The word "en" lets one combine several subjects in one sentence: 

> mi en sina li moku. -- You and I are eating.

Note that it is _not_ used to combine several verbs or objects -- the way to do
that was explained on [page 4](en/4).

The word "mute" allows to specify whether the subject (or object) is singular or
plural.

> jan utala mute -- many warriors

> mi mute -- we, us

Here are some example sentences:

> jan lili mute li lape. -- The children are sleeping.

> kiwen suli li pakala e tomo lipu. -- A big rock damaged the library ("house of
> books").

> mi pakala lili. -- I made a little mistake.

> ilo sina li kalama mute ike. -- Your instrument is making lots of bad noise.

## The word "ni"

The simplest use of the word "ni" is to mean "this" or "that":

> kulupu ni li pona mute. -- This community is very good.

However, it is much more powerful than that. The word "ni" can also be used to
create more complex sentences.

It can be used to talk about what other people say (or even quote them,
depending on context):

> jan lili li toki e ni: sina pona. -- The child said that you're good.

> ona li toki e ni: "toki! sina pona lukin." -- They said: "Hello! You look
> good."

Or it can be used to provide even more detailed descriptions of subjects or
objects.

> jan pali ni li pali e tomo mi: ona li jo e kiwen mute. -- The worker with lots
> of rocks built my home. ("This worker built my home: they have lots of
> rocks.")

## Dialectal differences

There doesn't seem to be an agreement whether or not "en" can be used within
phrases that use the particle "pi" (will be explained in [page 9](en/9)). In
addition, Sonja Lang herself said that using "en" to combine several objects is
"not completely
wrong"([1][mapona_en]), but rather stylistically inelegant.
