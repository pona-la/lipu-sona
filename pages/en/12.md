These are the final 10 official words in toki pona. They all function in the
same way as other words mentioned before, with one exception.

## alasa

The word "alasa" is sometimes used as a pre-verb meaning "to seek" or "to try":

> mi alasa sona e toki pona. -- I'm trying to learn toki pona.

## taso

The word "taso" can be used as a regular adjective to mean "only" or "just":

> mi lon tomo ni. -- I'm in this house.

> mi taso li lon tomo ni. -- Only I'm in this house.

> kulupu ona li jo e jan tu taso. -- Their community only has two people.

> mi pali taso. -- I was only working.

But, when added at the beginning of a sentence, it means "but" or "however":

> taso, tenpo kama li wile ala ante. -- But, the future refused to change.

In the official dictionary, "pu" is only defined as "interacting with the
official Toki Pona book". Usage of this word as "the official Toki Pona book"
itself, while common among some users, is unofficial. Sonja Lang personally
uses the noun phrase "lipu pu" to refer to the official book itself. (Though the
phrase "pu la" is also used in the book to mean "in this book").
