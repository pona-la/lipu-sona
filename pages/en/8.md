> loje jelo -- orange ("yellowish red")

## Example sentences

## Comparative sentences

While there are words in toki pona for "good" or "bad", there is no "better" or
"worse". While there are words for "lots" and "little", there's no "more" or
"less".

To make a comparative statement, you instead split it into two sentences:

> mi wawa. sina wawa lili. -- I am stronger than you. (I am strong.
> You are slightly strong.)

Of course, the degree of comparison can be adjusted by changing the difference
between the adjectives.

> mi wawa mute. sina wawa ala. -- I am way stronger than you. (I am very strong.
> You are weak.)
