This is a list of all official words in toki pona as described on the pages from
1 to 12, arranged alphabetically. You can click on the words to get to the
lesson they get introduced in. Each word is listed with different meanings
depending on which parts of speech it can be used as.

The "adjective" definition applies to both adjectives and adverbs, as the only
difference between the two in toki pona is if they apply to nouns or verbs.

A noun word can always be used as an adjective with the meaning "of [noun]". For
example, "moku soweli" can mean "animal food" or "meat", depending on context.

#### [kijetesantakalu](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: raccoon or other musteloid

This is one of the "joke words" created by Sonja Lang. It has become very 
popular among tokiponists, as has the sitelen pona character for it.

#### [kili](en/1)
* noun: fruit, vegetable, mushroom

#### [kin](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* particle: very, really, also

In the first official book, this word was merged with "**a**". However, many 
people use it separately from "a". They would only use "a" to emphasize 
someone's feelings.

#### [kipisi](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* verb: to cut, to divide

This is an old word that was not included in the first official book, but which 
many people still use. Those who want to only use *lipu pu* vocabulary might 
want to use "tu", which can also be used as a verb to mean "to divide", the same 
way "wan" means "to unite".

#### [kiwen](en/4)
* noun: hard object, metal, stone, solid
* adjective: hard, metallic, solid

#### [ko](en/4)
* noun: powder, clay, paste, semi-solid

#### [kokosila](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* verb: to speak not in toki pona in an environment where others speak toki pona

This word is taken from an Esperanto verb 
"[krokodili](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/krokodili)", which in turn means to 
not speak Esperanto in an Esperanto environment.

#### [kon](en/12)
* noun: air, essence, spirit, (unconventional) gas
* adjective: invisible, ephemeral, (unconventional) gaseous

#### [ku](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: the Toki Pona Dictionary by Sonja Lang
* verb: to interact with ku

Much like interacting with the first official toki pona book was given the word 
"pu", so does the second book with "ku". In fact, in *lipu ku*, words "ju", 
"lu", "nu", "su" and "u" are all listed as "(word reserved for future use by 
Sonja Lang)", presumably to be given to the next five official toki pona books 
that (in my opinion) should be created in the future. (In fact, Sonja Lang has
started publishing a series of illustrated story books, beginning with "The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz", that are collectively known as *lipu su*)

#### [kule](en/8)
* noun: color, (rare) gender
* adjective: colorful, painted
* verb: to paint smth a color

#### [kulupu](en/5)
* noun: group, community, company, society, nation, tribe

* verb: to hear, to listen, to obey

#### [la](en/9)
* particle: "if/when" (introduces context)

#### [lanpan](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* verb: to get, to take, to steal

Without this word, the typical way to express getting or taking something would 
be "kama jo e ..."  (to come into possession of ...), possibly with additional 
adjectives like "ike" or "utala". The word is famously used in the title of 
["lanpan pan"](https://ingwine.neocities.org/conlangs/tokipona/lanpan_pan.html), 
the toki pona translation/summary of Peter Kropotkin's "The Conquest of Bread".

#### [lape](en/5)
* noun: sleep, rest
* adjective: sleeping, restful
* verb: to sleep, to rest

#### [laso](en/8)
* noun/adjective: (the color) blue, green (and its shades)
* verb: to color something blue/green

#### [lawa](en/7)
* noun: head, mind
* adjective: main, primary, controlling, ruling
* verb: to head, to control, to direct, to guide, to lead, to own, to rule

#### [leko](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: square, block, (sometimes) stairs

This is an old word that was not included in the first official book, but which 
is actively used by people, as it's considered hard to express the meaning of 
"square" without it.

#### [len](en/9)
* noun: cloth, clothes, fabric, layer of privacy
* adjective: clothed, made of cloth/fabric
* verb: to clothe, to provide a layer of privacy

#### [loje](en/8)
* noun/adjective: (the color) red (and its shades)

#### [lon](en/6)
* noun: truth, life, existence
* adjective: real, true, present, existing
* verb w/o object: is true, exists
* preposition: in, at, on

#### [luka](en/9)

#### [mani](en/11)
* noun: money, large domesticated animal
* adjective: (unconventional) wealthy

#### [meli](en/2)
* noun: woman, female, wife
* adjective: feminine

#### [meso](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: middle, center
* adjective: average, moderate, mediocre

In some ways, this word is similar to "insa", but it also lets people say that a 
thing is moderately X without having to use phrases like "ona li wawa mute ala, 
li wawa lili ala".

#### [mi](en/1)
* noun: i, me, we, us 
* adjective: my, our

#### [mije](en/2)
* noun: man, male, husband
* adjective: masculine

#### [misikeke](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: medicine, cure
* adjective: medicinal
* verb: to cure

This word was invented by Sonja Lang, but was not included as part of *lipu pu*. 
(My personal guess is because "ijo pi pona sijelo" is a rather simple way to say 
"medicine" without it.)

#### [moku](en/2)
* noun: food
* adjective: edible, of food
* verb: to eat, to drink, to swallow

#### [moli](en/8)
* noun: death
* adjective: dead, dying

* adjective: back, rear

#### [monsuta](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: fear, monster
* adjective: scary, monstrous
* verb: to scare, to be afraid of, (sometimes) to turn into a monster

The usage of this word can be especially confusing without extra context. Some 
people refer to this confusion as 
["monsutatesu"](https://lipukule.org/post/2021/01/29/monsutatesu).

#### [mu](en/7)
* (any animal sound)

#### [mun](en/11)
* noun: moon, star, night sky object
* adjective: lunar, stellar

#### [musi](en/9)
* noun: game, art

* verb: to amuse, to play, to have fun

#### [mute](en/5)
* noun: quantity
* adjective: many, more
* number: 3 or more (simple system), 20 (complex system)

#### [n](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* interjection: um..., hm... ("thinking noise")

Technically, the word "n" breaks the rules of toki pona by using a non-allowed 
syllable, but as it basically functions as a word on its own, it's allowed. Or 
one can interpret syllable-final "n" as a separate mora, like in Japanese, 
where "n" on its own is apparently [also used as an 
interjection](https://jisho.org/search/%E3%82%93#)...

#### [namako](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: spice, addition
* adjective: additional, extra
* verb: to add, to spice up

In the first official book, this word was merged with "**sin**". However, many 
people keep using it separately from "sin". "sin" is interpreted to mean "new" 
and "namako" to mean "additional".

#### [nanpa](en/11)
* noun: number
* adjective: -th (ordinal indicator), mathematical, numeric, 
    (unconventional) digital

#### [nasa](en/8)
* adjective: weird, unusual, strange, drunk

#### [noka](en/6)
* noun: foot, leg, bottom, lower part, under (smth)

#### [o](en/7)
* particle: (addressing people, commands)

#### [oko](en/13) (*nimi ku suli*)
* noun: eye

In the first official book, this word was merged into "**lukin**". People who 
use this word separately from "lukin" typically use "oko" to mean "eye" and 
"lukin" to mean "sight" or "vision".
