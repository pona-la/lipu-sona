On July 19th, 2021, Sonja Lang has released an additional official toki pona
book, "[Toki Pona Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0978292367)" (also known
as "ku" or "lipu ku"). This book provides translations from English to toki pona
and vice versa for a whole lot of words, compiled from a community poll ran on
the toki pona community in 2020-2021, and documents 61 additional words used in
the language for a total of 181 "nimi ku". While most of these words are rarely
used in the community, there are 17 extra "nimi ku suli" words that have been
deemed frequent and important enough to be listed separately. This page shall
cover these new words.

The words "namako", "kin" and "oko" were listed as synonyms for "sin", "a" and
"lukin" respectively in *lipu pu*. However, in the community, these words have
somewhat different meanings:

* "sin" typically means "new", "namako" typically means "additional" or "extra".

* "kin" is used at the end of sentences for "also" or "too". "a" does not have
  such a specific usage.

* "oko" specifically means "eye", while "lukin" also means "vision" and "to
  see".

The words "kipisi", "leko", "monsuta" and "misikeke" were early words invented
before *lipu pu*'s publishing, and they are still used in the community today.
Some of these words were invented by Sonja Lang herself, such as
"kijetesantakalu" and "misikeke" (the former as a joke word, which ended up
being well-received by the toki pona community).

The rest are specifically newly-added words. Specifically, the word "ku" was
invented by Sonja Lang as an counterpart to "pu" to describe interacting with
the second official toki pona book.
