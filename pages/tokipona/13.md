On July 19th, 2021, Sonja Lang has released an additional official toki pona
book, "[Toki Pona Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0978292367)" (also known
as "ku" or "lipu ku"). This book provides translations from English to toki pona
and vice versa for a whole lot of words, compiled from a community poll ran on
the toki pona community in 2020-2021, and officially introduces 61 additional
words to the language for a total of 181 "nimi ku". While most of these words
are rarely used in the community, there are 17 extra "nimi ku suli" words that
have been deemed frequent and important enough to be listed separately. This
page shall cover these new words.

The words "namako", "kin" and "oko" were listed as synonyms for "sin", "a" and
"lukin" respectively in *lipu pu*. However, in the community, these words have
somewhat different meanings:

* "sin" typically means "new", "namako" typically means "additional" or "extra".

* "kin" is used at the end of sentences for "also" or "too". "a" does not have
  such a specific usage.

* "oko" specifically means "eye", while "lukin" also means "vision" and "to
  see".

The words "kipisi", "leko", "monsuta" and "misikeke" have existed before *lipu
pu*, but both were, and still are, actively used in the community.

The rest are specifically newly-added words. Two of these, "kijetesantakalu" and
"ku", were added by Sonja Lang herself -- the former as a "joke word" that was
well-received by the community and the latter as the name for the second
official toki pona book.
