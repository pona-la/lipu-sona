same way as other words mentioned before, with one exception.

## taso

The word "taso" can be used as a regular adjective to mean "only" or "just":

> mi lon tomo ni. -- I'm in this house.

> mi taso li lon tomo ni. -- Only I'm in this house.

> kulupu ona li jo e jan tu taso. -- Their community only has two people.

> mi pali taso. -- I was only working.

But, when added at the beginning of a sentence, it means "but" or "however":

> taso, tenpo kama li wile ala ante. -- But, the future refused to change.

## Dialectal differences

In the official dictionary, "pu" is only defined as "interacting with the

itself, while common among some users, is unofficial.
