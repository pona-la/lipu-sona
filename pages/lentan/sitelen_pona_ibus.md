# what is IBus?

IBus is an input method framework that is commonly used on Linux- and BSD-based
operating systems in order to allow input in languages with complex input 
methods, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese.

A user by the name of `cominixo#5443` (aka "jan Komi") has submitted to the 
Discord community "ma pona pi toki pona" the following guide to using IBus to 
type [sitelen pona](en/sitelen_pona) (with codepoints as defined by the UCSUR 
document). With permission, it (and the data file required) are reproduced here.

If you're on Linux, you can use IBus with tables, download the following file 
and run these commands (nanpa lili?):

```
sudo ibus-table-createdb -n /usr/share/ibus-table/tables/tokipona.db -s sitelen_pona_ibus.txt
ibus-daemon -drxR
```

Open "IBus Preferences", go to "Input Method", click "Add" and then select 
"sitelen pona" (which will be the last option under "English").

Use `[`,`_`,`]` for cartouches, `pi_` to start long pi and `'` to extend long pi 
(these can be changed if you edit `sitelen_pona_ibus.txt` and re-run the 
commands)
